Sir i am a little bit confuse that cant we connect the raspberry pi somehow to laptop to use the laptop's camera?
i think that we cant do this because how can we run two operating systems at the same time? ie raspbian and windows? 
i think it is necessary to have a separate camera because as we are doing motion detection using raspberry pi its completely
different from having a code in jupyter notebook and then running it using a laptops camera because it wasnt include
raspberry pi in it..
so is it final to have a separate camera and attaching it to raspberry pi and detecting motion by it?
one thing more that ive learnt about raspberry pi that raspbian operating system will be installed in pc then we ll
convert it into the SD card and then SD card will be put in raspberry pi.. so do we use the same method for the transference
of code or anything else?
